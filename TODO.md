### Todo
- American fuzzy lop?
- Grep codebase for todos
- Optimise wuchty
- Find out why gtest memes asan on clang

### Wuchty testing plan
- Write bruteforce version - needs to enumerate all stackings as well
-- current bruteforce runs only up to N = 25, which is at most ~11 branches 
-- will need way to run through every possible
- Compare to brute force
