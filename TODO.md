### Todo
- Grep codebase for todos
- Implement runners in run.py
- Cache results for ReconstructComputed / write dfs loader - should save O(N) time
- Write splay-tree
- Memory optimisation
-- Suboptimals return iterators that go through the things - avoids instantiating all the things at the same time
-- Change index_t to use unsigned bitfields
-- Change stuff in node_ts, expand_ts, index_ts to unsigned - just in case there are that many nodes.
-- Change ctds representation to indicate an index part instead => ctd_idx_t in one byte
--- Makes delta_node_t 30 bytes
--- num_node_t still at 34 bytes
